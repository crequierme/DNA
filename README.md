# DNA
The purpose of this code was to create a linked-list abstract data type which represents a DNA strand. The left and right helices are represented by linked lists and nucleotides are represented by elements in the linked list. Two nucleotides which are "across" from each other (one in left helix, other in same position on right helix) form a base pair containing two characters (e.g. "CG").
